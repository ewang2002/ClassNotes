# Scripts Folder
These are some random scripts that I have created to make life slightly easier for me. These will all be written in Python as I want to practice using Python (since I rarely use Python).

## Contents
- `create.py`: A script that creates blank `tex` files (with only the basics) for each class that I take notes for. The script will only create these files for classes the day before th actual lecture day (e.g. if a class is held on MWF and today is Monday, then this script will not create the blank file. However, if today is Tuesday, then the blank file will be created).
