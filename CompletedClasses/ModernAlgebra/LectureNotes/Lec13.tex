\section{Midterm Review}
Today is simply midterm review. 

\subsection{Page 257, Problem 29}
\begin{mdframed}[]
    List the distinct elements of $\Z[x] / \cyclic{3, x^2 + 1}$.
\end{mdframed}

\begin{proof}
    First, note that 
    \[\cyclic{3, x^2 + 1} = \{3 f_{1}(x) + (x^2 + 1)f_{2}(x) \mid f_{i}(x) \in \Z[x]\}\]
    Now, the elements of this ring is in the form 
    \[f(x) + \cyclic{3, x^2 + 1}\]
    An observation to see is that $f(x)$ must have degree less than 2. This is because 
    \[x^2 + 1 \in \cyclic{x^2 + 1} \implies x^2 + \cyclic{x^2 + 1} = -1 + \cyclic{x^2 + 1}\]
    In other words, the coset corresponding to $x^2$ is the same as the coset corresponding to $-1$. For example, if we had $x^3$, this would correspond to $x^2 x = (-1)x$ and $x^4$ would correspond to $x^2 x^2 = (-1)(-1) = 1$ and so on. So, we have 
    \[\Z[x] / \cyclic{3, x^2 + 1} = \left\{a + bx + \cyclic{3, x^2 + 1}\right\}\]
    Of course, we can't forget the 3 is a member of our ideal. So, 
    \[a = 3q_1 + r_1\]
    \[b = 3q_2 + r_2\]
    where $r_1, r_2 \in \{0, 1, 2\}$ so that 
    \[a + bx = 3q_1 + r_1 + (3q_2 + r_2)x = 3(q_1 + q_2 x) + r_1 + r_2 x\]
    and so it follows that 
    \[a + bx + \cyclic{3, x^2 + 1} = r_1 + r_2 x + \cyclic{3, x^2 + 1}\]
    Therefore, our answer is 
    \[\Z[x] / \cyclic{3, x^2 + 1} = \{r_1 + r_2 + \cyclic{3, x^2 + 1} \mid r_1, r_2 \in \Z / 3\Z\}\]
\end{proof}
