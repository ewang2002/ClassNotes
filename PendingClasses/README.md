# Pending Classes
These are notes for classes that I will be taking. The notes will most certainly not be completed. I make no guarantees that I'll update these (but I'll try). 

## Directories
Below, I'll very briefly list the notes contained in these folders.

### Fall 2021
- `AbstractAlgebra`: Notes for **Math 100A** taught by Professor Brandon Alberts.
- `AdvDataStructures`: Notes for **CSE 100** taught by Professor Niema Moshiri.
