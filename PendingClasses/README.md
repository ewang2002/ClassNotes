# Pending Classes
These are notes for classes that I will be taking. The notes will most certainly not be completed. I make no guarantees that I'll update these (but I'll try). 

## Directories
Below, I'll very briefly list the notes contained in these folders.
- `MATH187A`: Introduction to Cryptography w/ Professor Agrawal. My notes are very closely based on [his notes](https://sagrawalx.github.io/assets/crypt/). 
- `MATH170A`: Introduction to Numerical Analysis (Linear Algebra) w/ Professor Liu. 
- `POLI112A`: Economic Theories of Political Behavior w/ Professor Izzo.
    - These notes are not maintained.
