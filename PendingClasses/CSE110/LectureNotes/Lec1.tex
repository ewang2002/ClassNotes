\section{Lecture 1: April 3, 2023}
Building great software is hard. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $2/3$ of projects are late. 
    \item $1/4$ of projects have been canceled.
    \item $1/2$ of projects run over budget\footnote{Usually what happens if your projects are late}.
\end{itemize} 
Poor planning, users wanting more and more features (with them misunderstanding), and buggy released software are some causes.
