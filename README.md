# ClassNotes @ UCSD
These are course notes for some of the more interesting classes that I'm taking at UC San Diego. 

## Directories
- The `PendingClasses` directory contains notes for the classes that I am currently taking, or will soon take.
- The `CompletedClasses` directory contains notes for the classes that I have already completed.

## Disclaimer
My notes are not guaranteed to be accurate. You can, and probably should, assume that 
- there are numerous typos in my notes. 
- notation may be messy or inconsistent. 
- notes may be low-quality or otherwise inconsistent in quality. 

Note that my notes are heavily based on either the instructor's notes or notes from a textbook, and are revised for my own learning. **These notes are not endorsed by any instructor or any other third-party.**
