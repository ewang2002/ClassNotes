# ClassNotes @ UCSD
These are course notes for some of the classes that I'm taking. Please note that they are not guaranteed to be accurate or updated.

For all of the notes, unless otherwise specified, all images are by the professor (essentially, screenshots of course lecture slides or other supplied resources).

If you want to make any correction(s), please submit an [Issue](https://github.com/ewang2002/ClassNotes/issues) first.

## Directories
- The `PendingClasses` directory contains notes for the classes that I am currently taking, or will soon take.
- The `CompletedClasses` directory contains notes for the classes that I have already completed.
